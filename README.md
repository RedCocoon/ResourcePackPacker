# Resource Pack Packer
Modern solution to resource pack development
In this software, you can:
    Compare a resource pack with a reference jar
    Import textures from the reference jar with ease
    Mark a texture as completed for progresss checking purposes

Most of the buttons don't work right now, please wait for the next update when this software will be "feature complete".

# To Run:
1) Make sure you have Java 17 installed correctly. You can find the installation [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk-fx#download-openjdk).
2) OpenJFX should be included in the installation linked in (1). If you install Java 17 using other methods, make sure you have OpenJFX installed too.
3) Make sure the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set correctly.
4) You can check if (3) is correct by running `java -version` in a command prompt.
5) You can find the download to the jar [here](https://github.com/RedCocoon/resourcepackpacker/releases)
6) Simply double click the jar file to open it. Or use `java -jar "path/to/jar.jar"` to run.

# To Use:
1) Under File at top left, select the resource pack's mcmeta by clicking "Load"
2) Then, select a reference jar (E.G. 1.18.1.jar) (Modded jar files works too)
3) Select an image editor executable. This allows you to open a texture simply by double clicking the entry in the table.
